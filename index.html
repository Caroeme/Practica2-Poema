            <strong>Letra: </strong>
            <pre>

[Chorus]
(She's got the devil in her heart)
But her eyes, they tantalize
(She's going to tear your heart apart)
Oh, her lips, they really thrill me

[Verse 1]
I'll take my chances, for romance is
So important to me
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me

[Chorus]
(She's got the devil in her heart)
No, no, this I can't believe
(She's going to tear your heart apart)
No, no, nay will she deceive

[Verse 2]
I can't believe that she'll ever, ever go
Not when she hugs me and says she loves me so
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me
Listen, can't you see?

[Chorus]
(She's got the devil in her heart)
Oh, no, no, no, this I can't believe
(She's going to tear your heart apart)
No, no, nay will she deceive

[Verse 3]
Don't take chances if your romance is
So important to you
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me

[Chorus]
(She's got the devil in her heart)
No, no, no, no, this I can't believe
(She's going to tear your heart apart)
No, no, nay will she deceive

[Outro]
(She's got the devil in her heart)
'Cause she's an angel sent to me
(She's got the devil in her heart)
No, she's an angel sent to me
